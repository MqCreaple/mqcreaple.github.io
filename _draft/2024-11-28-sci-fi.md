**Summary (Spoiler Warning)**

~~Sarah, a single mother struggling financially after her divorce, became a data labeler for AI company NeuralConnect, which requires an expensive brain electrode implant. Despite the high pay, the job's demands and the implant's influence cause Sarah to become increasingly detached from her daughter, Mia, and obsessed with work. As Sarah adapts to the biases of the majority's preferences in tagging data, she notices changes in her neighborhood, with diverse cultural signs replaced by homogenized ones.~~

Sarah Lee sat quietly on the Blue Line as the evening sun dipped below the horizon. Glancing down, she noticed her daughter clutching her pink backpack strap with one hand while gripping the subway pole tightly with the other, as though trying to keep her distance but afraid to stray too far. Dangling from her backpack was an electronic name tag, with bold letters spelling “Mia Yang.”

“Mia, did you have a good day at school?” Sarah asked gently, breaking the silence. Her daughter responded with a small, wordless nod.

This routine had been the same ever since Mia started first grade. Not much had changed even after Sarah divorced her husband, Daniel Yang. She still caught early trains to pick Mia up from Roosevelt Elementary and brought her home by the same route. But now, instead of returning to their old apartment near Oakwood, she had to ride to Maple Ridge, a crumbling housing complex on the city outskirts, adding another line transfer and thirteen more stops to her commute.

Her evenings hadn’t changed much though. There were still meals to prepare, dishes to wash, homework to help with, and on rare occasions, a short trip to the nearby playground with her daughter. The monotony of this life had etched lines into Sarah’s face that no amount of makeup could hide.

Staring out at the darkened subway windows, Sarah caught sight of her own exhausted reflection. Suddenly, a looping promo jumps out of her sight. “*NeuralConnect: Embrace the future! Implant electrodes and connect instantly!*” The ad’s robotic spokesperson delivered the pitch with exaggerated enthusiasm, but Sarah found these new eye-tracking ads more irritating than inspiring.

“Next stop, Maple Ridge Station.” the automated announcement intoned. Sarah and Mia shuffled out with a sparse crowd, walking past rusted railings and graffiti-covered walls, their footsteps echoing up the mossy steps to their apartment building. Stopping in front of their unit, Sarah spotted a slip of paper wedged into the doorknob. Her chest tightened as she read the blocky, printed text:

> Notice of Utility Payment Due:
>
> Unit 203, Maple Ridge Apartments. August 29, 2062.
>
> Your electricity bill is overdue. Outstanding balance: $407.38. Please pay promptly to avoid service interruption.

Sarah sighed, her shoulders slumping under the weight of yet another financial worry. Rent, water, electricity, internet—she hadn’t paid any of them yet this month. With her part-time gig barely covering the essentials, she would have to swallow her pride and ask her sister for more money. Again.

Mia, watching her mother’s expression darken, said nothing. Sarah forced a smile. “What do you feel like eating tonight, honey? Mom will make something good for you, okay?”

But dinner was far from “good.” Sarah tossed a prepackaged meal into the microwave. It wasn’t cooking, really, just reheating.

“Three minutes to heat. Why not enjoy some relaxing music while you wait?” chirped the microwave’s smart assistant.

The overly cheerful voice stirred an unwelcome memory. Sarah’s thoughts drifted to her ex-husband, Daniel. He had started to change not long after Mia was born—working later, coming home smelling of whiskey. Their sporadic arguments had finally culminated in a bitter divorce a year ago. She couldn’t help but reflect bitterly: Even the microwave’s getting smarter, but people keep growing colder.

The microwave beeped, snapping her out of her thoughts. She pulled out a plastic tray of stir-fried beef and rice. The colors looked dull, the texture unappetizing, but Sarah didn’t have the luxury to be picky. It would do for now.

Staring at the lackluster meal, Sarah’s mind wandered again. She needed a steady job, a real chance to give Mia a better life. But for tonight, survival would have to be enough.

Late at night, Sarah Lee lay in bed, unable to fall asleep, while her daughter Mia slept deeply in the next room. Sarah wore her holo-glasses, scrolling through an endless cascade of visual feeds flickering in front of her eyes.

“Tragic: Local girl jumps to her death—here’s why…”

“Top 10 life hacks to save $200 this month…”

“Fashion tips for every budget—simple yet classy…”

“The hidden struggles of children from divorced families…”

“Kyle walked on the street, and what happens next was shocking…”

The flood of disconnected video snippets passed before Sarah’s tired eyes, serving as little more than mindless entertainment. But then, the ad she’d seen countless times popped up once more:

“*NeuralConnect: Embrace the future! Implant electrodes and connect instantly! Become a NeuralConnect data annotator—earn up to $7,000 a month from the comfort of your home! Easy to start, no training required!*”

It was the same robotic face, the same exaggerated mechanical voice. But this time, the ad’s words echoed louder and louder in her anxious mind, igniting a fragile spark of hope.

Sarah slipped off her holo-glasses and set them aside, letting the audio continue in her earpiece as she reached for her laptop. She typed “NeuralConnect data annotator job” into the search bar.

NeuralConnect is the biggest AI tech company in the country, Sarah thought. People dream of working there. Sure, this data annotator job might be grueling, but the pay has to be worth it.

She found the company’s recruitment page and filled in her identifications. Beside her, Mia’s soft breathing filled the room, and the faint green glow of her electronic name tag illuminated the dark. Sarah paused momentarily to glance at her daughter’s peaceful face before submitting the application. Her hands trembled slightly as she clicked the button, watching the page load with bated breath. But when the next screen appeared, her heart sank.

> **Recruitment Requirements**
>
> NeuralConnect data annotators must undergo a proprietary **NeuralConnect© Brain Electrode Implantation** at their own expense. Annotators’ neural electrodes are required to synchronize with the company’s database.

Though brain implant technology was advanced and widely available, Sarah knew it came with a hefty price tag. Her brow furrowed as she quickly did the math in her head.

“Rent, utilities, and internet come to $2,500 a month,” she murmured. “The implant surgery—at least $6,000. If it has to be compatible with NeuralConnect standards, it’ll cost close to $8,500.”

She thought of her dwindling savings—barely $10,000 left. If the job truly paid $7,000 a month as advertised, she could pay it back quickly. But what if it didn’t? What if the ad was exaggerated? She might not even be able to pay off the implant surgery, let alone keep their tiny apartment.

The night stretched in a heavy silence, broken only by the distant hum of machinery and the occasional murmur of the wind outside. Across the street, a few lights still glowed faintly in the windows of another run-down building, outshining the long-forgotten stars above.

Sarah pulled the crumpled utility bill from her pocket and smoothed it out on her lap. She turned to look at Mia again, her chest rising and falling steadily in her sleep.

“I don’t have a choice,” Sarah whispered to herself. “I have to take this chance.”

Her resolve hardened, Sarah checked her savings account, preparing to commit nearly everything to the Implantation surgery. This decision will be a gamble, but for Mia’s future, it would be one she had to make.

Two days later, Sarah Lee dropped off her daughter Mia at school and headed straight to Central City Hospital. Once a shining symbol of healthcare in the city, the hospital was now overcrowded and machines were outdated. The name “Central City Hospital” had endured for over a century, but it seemed out of place among the sleek, corporate-funded facilities like "CoreCare Medical" or "NeuroSource PharmaTech Hospital," not to mention the countless virtual clinics available. Still, Central City Hospital remained the most affordable option, despite its aging equipment.

The hospital lobby was packed with elderly patients. Some leaned on canes, others had prosthetic limbs or sat in wheelchairs. Sarah clutched a small data chip containing her medical records and squeezed into the elevator, exiting on the 7th floor where the neurology department was located.

Cold glow of fluorescent lights bathed the hallway, casting sharp shadows on the long line of expressionless faces. Sarah followed the crowded corridor until she reached a door marked “Brain Electrode Implantation Surgery”. Turning back, she traced her way to the end of the queue and found an empty plastic chair.

As the queue inched forward, Sarah's mind wandered. A fleeting moment of nostalgia for her life with Daniel crept in. At least back then, she hadn’t had to worry about money so much. But when the image of Daniel’s drunken, slumped-over face flashed in her mind, Sarah immediately reminded herself why she had left him. She wouldn't compromise her dignity for money, never.

Sarah was unaware of the time passed when the automated announcement called her name. Sarah pulled off her holo-glasses and squinted as the harsh afternoon light streamed into the waiting area. The large, sterile door to the operating room slid open, and a white-coated doctor emerged, his eyes fixed on a tablet in his hand.

“Sarah Lee? Is Sarah Lee here?” he asked without looking up.

Sarah raised her hand. The doctor gestured for her to follow him into the operating room. Sharp smells of disinfectant filled the air, and the metallic glint of the surgical robotic arms made her uneasy.

“The surgery will be quick,” the doctor said, inserting her medical data chip into a terminal near the surgical table. “Fifteen minutes, and it’s done. Based on your health report, you should have no major post-op issues. Recovery usually takes two to three days. You might experience mild headaches or temporary memory loss, but nothing severe.”

“I’m ready,” Sarah replied, her voice steady despite her nerves.

The doctor glanced at her. “Now, regarding the cost of the procedure,” he began. Sarah’s stomach tightened. “The total is $8,600. You can pay in full or $400 monthly through your bank account for 24 months…”

“Pay in full,” Sarah said quickly, cutting him off.

“Very well.” The doctor pulled over an old-fashioned screen and placed it in front of her. “Please review and sign the consent form carefully before we begin.”

Sarah’s head throbbed as her eyes skimmed over the densely packed text on the black-and-white screen. She scrolled through the document rapidly, scribbled her signature at the bottom, and hit the “Agree” button. The machine beeped, confirming her consent. Moments later, a cold sensation ran through her arm as the anesthetic injected in her veins. Sarah’s vision blurred, and she slipped into unconsciousness.

At the bottom of the consent form, in small, almost unnoticeable print was the following clause:

> Signing this agreement grants permission for portions of your neural data to be anonymously sent to NeuralConnect Database for optimization and personalized recommendations.

---

Sarah only vaguely remembered her surgery day. After the implantation, she had been wheeled out of the operating room on an automated chair, her head heavy and her thoughts clouded. She dimly recalled descending the elevator, boarding the subway, and somehow finding her way home. Once there, Sarah felt her mind begin to clear. She walked to her dresser, splashed cold water on her face, and turned her back to the mirror. She loosened her hair, uncovering the small metal electrodes hidden beneath. She touched the end of one electrode tentatively and felt no pain, but she still shivered involuntarily.

Closing her eyes, Sarah steadied herself. “For Mia’s future,” she thought, “this is worth it.”

Back in her room, Sarah powered on her laptop and followed the instructions on NeuralConnect’s website to sync her implants with the company’s system. The screen loaded a new page:

> Welcome, Sarah Lee
>
> Extracting neural data...
>
> You may experience unusual visuals during this process. Please remain seated and stay calm.

Sarah stared at the text, her heart pounding. Suddenly, her vision blurred, and an array of black-and-white stripes appeared. Then, the stripes shift rapidly into a swirling, colorful circle. Moments later, the circle fades into a blurry face. Sarah blinked, astonished, but before she could process what she was seeing, the image disappeared.

> Neural data extraction complete.
>
> You will now undergo a tagging verification test.
>
> A short scene will be shown, followed by a description. Please evaluate whether the description matches the scene.

Sarah’s vision blurred again, and this time, she found herself watching a vivid scene. A man and a woman stood on a beach. Waves roll gently onto the sand behind the two figures. The man knelt on one knee, holding a bouquet of bright red roses. The woman tilted her head slightly, her white dress shimmering in the golden glow of the setting sun.

As the scene unfolded, a voice spoke directly in Sarah’s mind: “Evaluate the following description: ‘A man proposes to a woman on a beach.’”

Before Sarah could fully articulate her agreement, the voice responded: “Tagging verified as correct.”

The scene faded away, and Sarah’s attention returned to her laptop. The screen displayed a final message:

> Welcome, Sarah Lee. Your work officially begins today!

Sarah closed the laptop, exhaling deeply. Exhausted, she lay back on the bed and glanced at the digital clock as it ticked over to 02:58:14.

Sitting up abruptly, she muttered to herself, “Time to pick up Mia.”

---

The next day, Sarah officially began her new job. After dropping Mia off at school and activating the cleaning robot, Sarah sat at her desk, connected her brain electrodes, and began watching an endless stream of scenes. Every second, thousands of such short videos and their corresponding tags were sent and verified by data annotators worldwide. These tags were then returned to NeuralConnect’s headquarters, feeding the company’s next-generation AI model, Zeus.

When Sarah saw a comedic clip of several South Asian immigrants discussing their English accents, she marked the corresponding description as “correct” without hesitation. But ten minutes later, a notification popped up:

> Your tag, “South Asian immigrants discussing their English accent” has been determined to be “incorrect” by the majority. This tag will not count toward your work today.

Sarah frowned in confusion. It was the fourth time she’d received such notification since starting work today. Frustrated, she disconnected the electrodes and turned to an online forum to figure out the source of these inexplicable errors.

A few minutes later, an anonymous user sent her a link. Clicking on it, Sarah was redirected to NeuralConnect’s payment guidelines for data annotators:

> To ensure the accuracy of data tagging, the same video and tags are sent to annotators around the country for verification. The majority opinion among these annotators determines the correct tag.
>
> If your tag matches the majority opinion, it is recorded as a valid tag. Otherwise, it is recorded as invalid. Payment is based on the number of valid tags completed in a day.

Sarah was baffled. “But my tags were correct,” she muttered. “Why wouldn’t the majority think so?” Hoping for answers, she posted another query on the forum. This time, even after a long wait, no one responded. Sarah sighed, reconnected her electrodes, and returned to work.

That afternoon, the piercing alarm clock pulled Sarah out of her work. She disconnected the electrodes and looked at her work summary on the screen:

> Data Annotator: Sarah Lee
>
> Valid Tags: 368
> Invalid Tags: 302
> Accuracy: 54.9%
>
> Daily Earnings: $40.2

“How is almost half of my work considered invalid?” Sarah grumbled in frustration.

No matter how dissatisfied she felt about her day’s work, Sarah reminded herself to push her irritation aside. It was time to pick up Mia from her school.

---

The subway screeched against the aging tracks, filling the carriage with an ear-piercing noise. Sarah leaned against the wall, feeling more exhausted than ever before. Even a day of sedentary mental labor could leave her utterly drained.

Mia, noticing her mother’s weariness, spoke up for the first time in a while. “Mom, are you okay?”

“I’m fine, Mia,” Sarah replied with a weary smile. “Just tired from work. How about we have some delicious food for dinner tonight?”

Mia didn’t say another word, simply gazing silently at her mother. Sarah lifted her head and looked around the subway car, observing the tired commuters shuffling back and forth. It was like looking at countless reflections of herself.

The subway’s outdated buzzer let out three sharp beeps, urging Sarah and Mia to get out. Sarah took Mia’s hand, stepping off the train onto the empty platform.

---

Golden leaves of autumn have almost all fallen, though not a single piece of snowflake has touched the ground yet. Sarah Lee gradually adapts to her new work routine and her job as a data annotator.

She had also figured out some patterns of the “majority’s” preference. For example, most labelers would simply label “incorrect” for videos longer than 5 minutes, no matter if the description is correct or not. Why waste five minutes struggling through something that might not even count as paid work, when one could review two or three shorter clips at the same time?

Besides that, videos featuring foreign cultures and immigrants were almost all labeled as “incorrect”, while videos related to science or technology were marked “correct,” regardless of the content's alignment with the description. Sarah couldn’t fathom why the people on the other end of the internet had these preferences, but she figured it didn’t matter. Following the majority meant more payment—so why not?

The ticking of the alarm clock brought Sarah back to reality. A glance at her screen revealed a 93.7% accuracy rate. Satisfied, she hurriedly shut her laptop and headed for the subway station.

On the train, the now-familiar sense of fatigue flooded her brain and soon spread to her limbs. Her heart raced, her body felt weak, and she clung to the handrail, panting and barely able to stay on her feet. Why am I so tired? she thought. If only I could get home sooner, lie in bed, and keep working on those annotations…

She was soon shocked by her thought. When had she started to prefer working to spending time with her daughter? Wasn’t giving Mia a better life her entire reason for taking this annotator job in the first place?

That night, the dinner table was as silent as usual. But the silence had changed from one-sided to mutual. Sarah no longer had the energy or the will to ask Mia about her day at school. After the meal, Sarah retreated to her room to continue annotating short videos. Mia sat alone in her room, scribbling on her homework and drawing pictures.

As Sarah worked, Mia burst into the room, shouting that she wanted to go out and play.

Annoyed but trying to suppress her irritation, Sarah replied softly, “Mia, don’t be upset. Mommy has work to do. I’ll take you out to play later, okay?”

“You’ve changed, Mommy! I want my old mommy back, not the one who works all the time!” Mia’s voice cracked with sobs.

Sarah froze. Mia was right—she had changed. She stopped taking her daughter to the park, stopped thinking about anything other than work. All she wanted now was nothing but to annotate more videos.

After a long pause, she finally said, “Mia, you’ll understand when you’re older.”

Even as the words left her lips, Sarah felt disgusted with herself. What a terrible mother I’ve become, she thought bitterly.

Mia said nothing more. She turned and walked back to her room without a backward glance.

The family portrait Mia had drawn at the age of two was still hanging on her wall. The mother’s face had been scribbled over with black marker.

On NeuralConnect’s labor contract, there was a tiny line of print Sarah had overlooked:

> To ensure the mental and emotional well-being of data annotators under high-intensity workloads, the Company reserves the right to activate deep neural electrodes in the Contractor’s brain, in order to suppress serotonin reuptake and promote the release of dopamine and endorphins, alleviating stress-related mental health effects.

---

Sarah Lee lay in bed, tossing and turning, her daughter’s words echoing ceaselessly in her mind.

*Have I really changed?*

*I guess I have.*

A faint, insistent whisper seemed to rise from somewhere deep in her brain:

“*Forget your worries, forget your exhaustion—just keep working!*”

Sarah felt as though she was addicted to her job, unable to stop even for a moment. The craving was so intense that even in her dreams, she desperately longed to click on the next short video.

Frowning deeply, she shook her head, trying to dispel the thought. She resolved that no matter what happened tomorrow, she would not let the company access her brain electrodes again. Sarah decided that after dropping off Mia in the morning, she would take a walk outside and let nature soothe her restless mind.

As these thoughts swirled in her head, the darkness outside her window began to dissipate. In the east, the first rays of dawn stretched across the horizon.

Sarah stood up, walked to Mia's room, and started packing up her books for today's school. Sarah noticed that her Spanish textbook was gone, in its place was a new book: American Language and Culture.

After breakfast, Sarah and Mia walked out of their apartment to the patchy road. Sarah glanced up at the signs on either side—signs she hadn’t paid attention to for a long time. The street felt both familiar and faintly strange, having changed imperceptibly over just two months.

Sarah faintly remembered dining in the Chinese restaurant at the end of the street. But now, a newly opened fast food chain restaurant has taken its place. Large white LED lamps outlined the letters “McDonald's.” Staff are smiling and waving to customers. But Sarah only felt unfamiliar, even a little absurd.

The Mexican restaurant on the opposite side of the road was also gone. Sarah couldn't imagine how that restaurant run by the friendly Mexican couple was wiped out of existence.

Sarah couldn't remember what was the last time she saw any “Jamaican flavor”, “Chinese cuisine”, “Indian food”, or any such signs.

Sarah recalled the countless videos of foreign countries she labeled as “wrong” in her data annotator work, vaguely sensing a connection between what she'd done and what was happening now, though she couldn’t quite place it. Her daughter, Mia, seemed unbothered as if she had always known the signs had changed, walking ahead, lost in her own thoughts.

---

That winter, there were three snowfalls, and right after the third came a light rain that brought warmth and renewal. The frozen ground slowly thawed, and tender green buds began to sprout from the mountains, rivers, and trees. Faced with the pressures of life, Sarah Lee continued her work as a data annotator. The preferences of the “majority” for marking data kept changing, and Sarah worked hard to learn how to mark things the way the “majority” did.

One day, Sarah sat on the subway, watching a public service ad about domestic violence playing on the subway screen. In the video, an alcohol-addicted husband came home late every night, abused his wife, and later the wife divorced her husband. Bold text at the bottom of the screen read, “Reject domestic violence, protect healthy families.”

“This label is wrong, isn’t it?” Sarah murmured to herself.
