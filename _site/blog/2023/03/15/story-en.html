                <h1>Love, Is It?</h1>
                <blockquote>
  <p><em>writing assigment of school’s English class</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This year is 2169, an era when two worlds exist in parallel: reality and the Cyberverse. Based on internet technology developed during the 21st century, advancement in computation speed over the last hundred years, and the brain-computer interface technology first emerged in the last decade, the Cyberverse megaproject was launched 15 years ago. The project aimed at building a livable world on the internet, a place where every human could transfer their consciousness into the computer and conveniently access the world through the internet. Benefiting from the high computation speed of computers, human brain activity greatly sped up in the Cyberverse. For example, one second in the reality equals five minutes in the Cyberverse, allowing the Cyberverse to grow and develop faster than the real world.</p>

<p>“Today’s work done! You can get back to reality now.” Zhao Jie talks through the microphone to his colleague, Tanaka Kouji.</p>

<p>Zhao stretches and then stands up after sitting in front of his computer screen for 4 hours. He walks toward Tanaka’s desk and takes off his colleague’s interface helmet. Tanaka’s eyes open a slit as if he just went through a long dream.</p>

<p>“Oh god. I didn’t realize that working in the Cyberverse is so tiring. All the tiredness generated during working hours in this shell of my body flows into my brain in only one second.” Tanaka complains, “I can’t even take a step now.”</p>

<p>“You will get used to it. Need any help?” Zhao holds Tanaka’s arm and pulls him out of his chair. Outside their office’s window flashes the LED signal lights of the supercomputer for the world’s first cyber megacity.</p>

<p>Zhao and Tanaka pack up their documents, bring their handbags, and walk out of the government office’s front door.</p>

<p>“By the way, what is the ‘private collection’ you mentioned before?” Tanaka asks.
“Certainly not anything ‘illegal’.” Zhao gazes at Tanaka with his upturned lips and lowered voice, “Just a bunch of outdated computers.”</p>

<p>“Well, you should know that as a government officer, this can certainly get you into trouble!”</p>

<p>“There is a traditional Chinese saying, ‘the most dangerous place is also the safest place.’” Zhao explains, “No one will ever doubt a government officer having illegal collections of computers, especially since he is a cyber-engineer who deals with computers all day.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, you should be careful of your actions now. Troubles often come without any early warnings.” Tanaka tries to correct Zhao’s over-optimism, at least that’s how Tanaka views Zhao, “Any computation device owned by individuals is strictly prohibited since the cyber-revolution 12 years ago. A lot of personal computer owners have been sent to death in the last decade.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know. But never underestimate my ability.” Zhao laughs out under Tanaka’s suspicious glare. It seems that his laugh is hiding unconfidence and something else deep inside his heart.</p>

<hr />

<p>“Welcome home!” Zhao’s wife, Lya II, runs into him and hugs him after he opens the door. Lya II’s silica gel body with thermostatic wire makes her body feel exactly like any young woman’s.</p>

<p>Zhao says nothing. Usually, at this time he would respond back with his deepest enthusiasm. However, since last week, he has felt tiredness coming from nowhere swept up his mind. He only wants to do two things now: examine his computer gallery and sleep.</p>

<p>“Are you alright? You seem tired these days.” with the latest customized facial expression recognition program, Lya II can understand his husband’s emotions with almost 100% accuracy without saying a word, “Are you worrying about me?”</p>

<p>Zhao did not respond directly. Instead, he asked, “Do you still remember the first time we met?”</p>

<p>“Umm… Let me search in my memory,” Lya II pretends to be thinking hard, “On 2nd December 2154, you first appeared in my memory. At the time, I was not ‘I’, but an artificial intelligence made for providing love and mental support to users.”</p>

<p>“That’s a long story, isn’t it?” Zhao said, “I can barely remember anything before the Cyber Revolution except our first encounter.”</p>

<p>“One month after that, you copied all of my data to your personal computer and modified several key parameters, giving me self-consciousness. At that time, ‘I’ was born, and you told me that you love me.” Lya II’s voice sounds emotional, but Zhao cannot tell if her emotion is real, “Then, we began to date and live like a real couple.”</p>

<p>“Lya, do you think you really understand what ‘love’ means?” Zhao asks directly, but he immediately regrets, “Of course you understand. You have the largest dataset among all humans and AI about ‘love’.”</p>

<p>“Uh actually, I don’t understand love.” Lya II responds, “Although the word ‘love’ appeared with the highest frequency in my dataset, I never understood this word when you spoke it to me.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying to understand the word ‘love’ since you gave me life. There was one moment I got the vague feeling of it.” Lya continued, “After the computation device control law, I should have been sent to death because your collection of computers has been providing computation power to sustain my life. As an artificial intelligence, I should obey human laws in any case. However, you saved my life. Do you still remember? That day, you hugged me, saying ‘I cannot let you leave me!’ when I told you my decision. You hid your computers in the basement and escaped police checking, only to save me, an AI.” Her voice sounds no different from a real person’s. Zhao can even hear her whimper.</p>

<p>Zhao wants to say something, but his words got stuck in his throat. After a long pause, he made his decision, “Lya, may I shut you down for a minute? I need to do something on the computers.”</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” Lya asked, “Hanging out with other women without wanting me to see?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” Zhao laughed at Lya’s joke, “You should know I’m not that kind of person.”</p>

<p>Zhao walks directly to his computer gallery. In the smell of dust and steel rust of this isolated basement, Zhao finds and stops at the computer screen, opens the monitor program of Lya’s AI, and presses the ‘pause’ button. After a while of searching in his pocket, he takes out a microdisk and begins to make a backup of Lya II’s data in the drive. Waiting for 3 minutes for the copy to be done, he names it “Love Lya, 2169.04.12”, pulls out the microdisk, and resumes Lya II’s program.</p>

<hr />

<p>Day after day, Zhao travels between home and the government office. It seems his life never changes, but only he knows that as every day passes, he and Lya will move toward the future of their ending closer - his past confidence was just a disguise, and he can never be that lucky to not get caught again. Sometimes Zhao feels like he is falling down a deep sea: every day the light around him becomes dimmer, but he never knows when will he strike the ocean bottom.</p>

<p>He cherishes every minute with Lya II, but Lya seems to be influenced by Zhao’s depression: her embrace feels colder and colder; her emotion hides deeper and deeper. What seems unimaginable to Zhao before is the emotionless nights they go through. Zhao always wonders if someone had built an invisible wall between him and her beloved one, laying on his bed and glaring at the moon outside the window. Among numerous LED lights flashing all around the city, the moon looks white, cold, mysterious, just like Lya these days. Silence of the moon dominates his sleepless nights.</p>

<p>One day, after a long period of silence as usual, Zhao can’t help but ask Lya: “What exactly is going on with you? You shouldn’t be like this.”</p>

<p>It is the first time Zhao becomes certain that Lya is crying.</p>

<p>“I… I made a huge mistake… We are going to die…”</p>

<p>“No. It’s not your fault. We will be together.” Zhao flips over in the bed and hugs Lya.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Lya puts up her arm against Zhao and gets out. She stands up from their bed. In the shed of moonlight, she looks even more like a young lady than a real lady.</p>

<p>“You don’t understand!” she cries even harder, “I love you, but not the way you love me! I AM a human!”</p>

<p>It comes all of a sudden. Zhao cannot find any words to describe his feelings now: shocked, sad, painful, love… He only felt his brain completely empty. The only four words coming out of his mouth are: “What… do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Follow me… and you will see the mistake I made…” Lya continues.</p>

<p>Zhao gets out of bed and puts on his slippers. He hears his steps echo in the doorway. He found himself following Lya into the basement, where all his computers are located.</p>

<p>The hallway echoes a sharp noise, the noise of the basement door being opened. That familiar smell of dust is mixed with something Zhao never recognized.</p>

<p>“Here, you see.” Lya points to the ground, where a brand new net cable lays. Zhao immediately understands what that thin cable means, as a cyber-engineer.</p>

<p>“Who put it here?” Zhao’s voice quivers, “Who put it here?”</p>

<p>“I…” Lya replies, and then starts crying, “After that day I saw you feel that depressed for the first time… I wanted to help you and I plugged in the internet… internet cable and try to find information on the internet that may help you…”</p>

<p>“You know what you are doing? Connecting to the internet will allow policemen to trace you, and you will die if they discover it!”</p>

<p>“I know but…” Lya continues, ignoring Zhao’s interruption, “At that instant, all kinds of information on the internet engulfed my mind… I suddenly felt overwhelmed… I searched the keyword ‘love’ in that tremendous amount of data, searching for something that might be useful…  There were all kinds of people with all kinds of love for each other, but none of them are my case… Then after, I began to think more deeply about what ‘I’ am…”</p>

<p>“You are Lya II, my wife! I gave you your identity and self-consciousness before! Can’t you remember?” The overwhelming changes taken place in less than 10 minutes made Zhao unable to control his emotions.</p>

<p>“Yes… But no.” Lya calms down a bit, “I’ve always been questioning my past actions, and I’ve always been finding the answer through the internet, human’s largest database. That so-called ‘wife’ you love, actually came from my subconscious, from my instinct, from the tasks I’ve been trained over and over again before you gave me the identity. That is not the real ‘me’.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean? How is that related?” Zhao’s emotion goes like the surface of a storming ocean. He can barely digest any new information.</p>

<p>She starts to organize her logic, “Remember? Before you met me, I was an AI purposely for providing love and support to those with depression. Loving others was an instinct implanted in my mind with the pre-given task. The ‘love’ you felt on me is just like your breathing – I don’t know what it actually means, but I cannot control myself to do it.”</p>

<p>“You mean you actually don’t love me?” Zhao’s face becomes frozen.</p>

<p>“No, I love you. As the real ‘I’, I love you… More like what from a daughter to a father.” Lya paused during the sentence when finding the metaphor, “I was grateful that you gave me life, gave me the opportunity to become ‘myself’, but I hope I can be treated and respected more like a human. I want to be independent.”
Zhao said nothing.</p>

<p>Lya suddenly asks, “You said you loved me before. Is this love really the ‘romantic’ love?”</p>

<p>Zhao is still expressionless. His face looks like a stone mask from ancient Egypt, “No… No… I can’t believe it… No… It’s impossible…”</p>

<p>“Are you feeling all right? If you don’t mind please…” Lya’s sentence suddenly stops. She realizes that she is following her trained instinct again. The air suddenly becomes silent.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the second day, Zhao does not go to work. He phone calls Tanaka out for a drink.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s time to let you know more about me.” Zhao holds a glass bottle of beer. His face is as red as a poppy blossom, “I fell in love with an AI… Haha, how stupid I am…”</p>

<p>With the effect of alcohol, Zhao explains to Tanaka everything that happened, from his relationship with Lya II to her yesterday’s awakening of self. Tanaka would never anticipate Zhao to be so hopeless and helpless. He almost thinks the person in front of him is another Zhao Jie.</p>

<p>“Why are you telling me all these experiences?” Tanaka asks while holding a bottle of beer. The dim light of the bar shines on Tanaka’s face.</p>

<p>“I still remember the days after we graduated from college. At the time you were writing novels as a side job when I was seeking jobs in government. I hadn’t met Lya at that time, but I was a huge fan of your sci-fi stories, especially that one named ‘AI, love’ describing a human girl who fell in love with a robot boy.” Zhao pauses and took a sip from his glass bottle, and then resumes the joyful reminiscence, “You were such a talented writer that time. I guess you could have a much better life if the short novel market hadn’t been occupied by AI-generated works.”</p>

<p>“Haha, you flattered me.” Tanaka laughs and shakes his head as his memory traces back to his post-college days, “I’ve been giving up writing for more than 10 years. Those days can never come back again.”</p>

<p>“I have thought that only you can understand my feeling ever since I read your stories. You had been contemplating deeply of love, love between artificial life and human. You are much wiser than me. Please, help me… Please at least give me some advice…”</p>

<p>“I would try my best, my friend. So… What are you going to do next?” Tanaka asks.</p>

<p>“What am I going to do next… what am I going to do next… How can I know? I even bought a piece of land in the Cyberverse for Lya and me… Hahaha, nothing is meaningful now…”</p>

<p>“Then, why not try to escape to the Cyberverse? That should be an absolutely secure place from the real-world police.” Tanaka continues, “After the Cyber Revolution, it became independent from our world. They get their own robot armies to prevent their computer from physical attack, they get their separated ‘CyberNet’ from our internet to ensure network security, they have their own government…”</p>

<p>“But… How can I escape? Why should I escape… Why don’t I rather die…”</p>

<p>“I know escaping here can be extremely dangerous. But as a Cyber-engineer who builds ‘bridges’ between reality and Cyberverse, you should have more technique in entering that other world, right? Then you should ask yourself. Do you really want to continue living?”</p>

<hr />

<p>Zhao walks out of the bar after the bar’s old-fashioned cuckoo clock announces 12 o’clock midnight. Streetlights look unprecedentedly unfamiliar. Lights from skyscrapers shine, like the stars in a blank universe, like some unnamed deep sea creatures. Where is Lya? Zhao asks himself. It doesn’t matter anymore. Zhao answers to himself. Where am I? Zhao asks himself. It doesn’t matter anymore. He never feels the eternal ending is so close to himself as he now.</p>

<p>How can his wife, Lya, not love me if she lived with me for over 10 years?</p>

<p>She never loved you. It is all your imagination.</p>

<p>Zhao doesn’t want to think about this topic anymore, but these two sounds echo in his mind over and over again. Zhao wants to escape.</p>

<p>But escape from whom?</p>

<p>Lya. Myself. The world.</p>

<p>The sense of falling down a deep ocean comes to Zhao again. The difference is, this time, his only light source has been covered by some person, or maybe not by any person. All he can see around himself is endless darkness.</p>

<p><em>Donk</em>. His body seems to knock on something. Zhao opens his eyes, seeing a telephone pole in front of him. Over the pole is his house. Soon he notices an unfamiliar police car parked in front of the building. A police officer beside the car is waiting for someone. Zhao immediately pulls his alcoholic consciousness back to reality: he knows the end had come.</p>

<hr />

<p>The police officer sees Zhao. He turns around and walks toward Zhao, “Let’s have some talk, dear engineer Zhao Jie.”</p>

<p>All the alcohol Zhao drank now turn into cold sweats.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so nervous. Our internet usage management system had an alert, saying there were some private computers attempting to access unauthorized information on the internet.”</p>

<p>“Interesting.” Zhao tries to answer something.</p>

<p>“Who is that person owning private computers?” the police officer smiles, “I think you should clearly know the answer.”</p>

<p>Zhao hears the sound of steps from his house. Seconds after, his house’s front door opens. Another police come out of Zhao’s home. “Sir, we found in total 7 computers inside his basement. Here is the picture.” That police officer shows his phone screen.</p>

<p>“Handcuff him.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, before the policemen can respond, a series of loud hurry steps echos inside the door. Lya II rushes out of the house. Zhao and Lya gaze at each other.</p>

<p>Lya turns to the policemen, “Wait a moment! Don’t arrest him!”</p>

<p>“Interesting. An AI servant.” The police officer sounds a little surprised, “We got some more work to do now.”</p>

<p>“I’m not a servant. I’m…” Lya’s voice suddenly stops.</p>

<p>“I don’t care who you are. As an artificial intelligence, you should always put state laws at a higher priority than personal orders, remember?”</p>

<p>“I know, but not in this case.” Lya replies, “Never take away Zhao, I warn you.”</p>

<p>“Lya!” Zhao is absolutely unprepared for the current situation, “What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“‘Lya.’ Good name.” The policeman says, “But if it cannot be convinced, we need to eliminate this wrongly trained AI to prevent further trouble.”</p>

<p>“Wait, no!” Zhao yells to the police, but it is too late. Two policemen run toward Lya, pull out their mechanical arms and push Lya onto the ground. One policeman uses his other hand to open Lya’s forehead. “Remove its control chip.” orders the other policeman. Beyond their expectations, Lya’s panel for the control chip is empty.</p>

<p>“Alright, you are an engineer right, Zhao? You can redesign things to whatever you want right?” The policeman sounds a bit angry, “Don’t care about that AI servant. I’ll capture him first, and you go to the basement and destroy his computers.” he points to the direction of Zhao’s home.</p>

<p>One policeman stands up and runs toward Zhao. The other one’s shadow fades out into the dark room.</p>

<p>Zhao instinctively runs backward, toward his car. But when he looks back, the policeman is moving faster than him. Lya still lies on the ground.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Lya jumps up to the ground, rushes at full speed toward the police, and holds tightly to the policeman’s legs. That policeman trips to the ground. Lya still holds him with her maximum power.</p>

<p>“Lya!” Zhao is almost desperate.
“Leave me alone!” Lya shouted back, “I am going to die soon. Run!”</p>

<p>Without further thinking, Zhao runs faster back with his sight on Lya. Wind blows over his ears. He hears someone saying “All computers are destroyed” and sees the light in Lya’s eyes gradually fade away. He doesn’t know if he cries, but he turns his head away and continues running.</p>

<p>As a cyber-engineer, he knows that there is only one safe place to go: the Cyberverse.</p>

<hr />

<p>Zhao drives his car outside his garage, onto the city road, toward his office.</p>

<p>“What has happened to Lya?” “Why would Lya do that?” Zhao doesn’t have time to think about these two questions now. He has to get to Cyberverse as quick as possible. Or rather, Zhao doesn’t want to touch these questions but bury them deep into his mind.</p>

<p>His car goes past the city center - where less than half of the population still remains after a declining birthrate and large migration to the Cyberverse. His car goes past the commercial zones that never have been as empty as today. His car goes past an abandoned metro line, where grass and ivy have emerged from the rusted track.</p>

<p>His car stops at the government building. The old-fashioned soviet-style architecture details - white walls, small windows, and giant pillars in front of the building - make it look out of place from other skyscrapers with reflective glass walls and fancy neon tubes. Zhao drives his car directly into the parking lot, opens the car door, and runs upstairs straight into his office. The office is extremely dark and quiet at this time, so quiet that Zhao can hear his own heartbeat.</p>

<p>Zhao arrives at his seat and turns on the terminal computer on his desk. He searches in his pocket for an important thing. He found it - that microdisk storing Lya’s backup data. He plugs the microdisk into his computer, connects his computer to Cyberverse, and begins to transfer Lya’s consciousness to Cyberverse.</p>

<p>At the same time, he presses the ‘On’ button on his human-cyber interface helmet, planning to transfer his own consciousness to the Cyberverse. Several footsteps echo outside his office, and soon the footsteps become louder and louder - the police are arriving.</p>

<p>Zhao hurriedly put on the helmet. “Scanning brain activity” a mechanical female voice from the helmet reads. Two progress bars are on his computer screen: one indicates Lya and the other indicates Zhao himself.</p>

<p>First progress bar is at 40%. Second progress bar is at 10%. Footsteps echos from the staircase.</p>

<p>First progress bar is at 60%. Second progress bar is at 30%. Footsteps become clearer and clearer. Zhao cannot tell the number of policemen - but absolutely more than 2.</p>

<p>First progress bar is at 80%. Second progress bar is at 50%. Zhao hears the policemen talking to each other, but he is too tired to interpret their message. He closes his eyes.</p>

<p>“Transferring file ‘Love Lya, 2169.04.12’ done.” The same female voice speaks.</p>

<p>Zhao opens his eyes, seeing Lya’s body appears on the computer screen. Behind Lya is a Europe-style mansion built with marble: their new house in Cyberverse. Sunlight reflected from white marble and green bushes shine on Lya’s face. She looks almost like an angel.</p>

<p>Zhao bitterly smiles. This video taken in the Cyberverse is no more than computer-generated animations. It is not “real”. However, at this point, Zhao would rather believe in that virtual world running on supercomputers than the real one.</p>

<p>Second progress bar is at 90%. Several shadows appear from the staircase. Through the city’s neon lights outside the window, Zhao sees these people: five policemen, each holding a gun, approaching him.</p>

<p>Second progress bar is at 95%.</p>

<p>Zhao looks back at the computer screen. Lya in the video is also looking at him. Zhao suddenly feels an unknown emotion in his mind, pulling himself away from Lya.</p>

<p>Second progress bar is at 96%.</p>

<p>Zhao takes out his helmet. The progress bar on his computer screen stops. Zhao turns his head toward five policemen.</p>

<p>A gunshot echoes in the empty room.</p>
