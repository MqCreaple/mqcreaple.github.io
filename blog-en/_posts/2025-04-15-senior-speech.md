Before I start my speech, I’ll ask everyone a question: “Who am I”?

[Interact with the audience. Throw out questions such as “If you think you know who I am, raise your hand.”]

Of course, everyone knows that I’m Tom, a senior in PRISMS, a STEM student, your Albemarle house leader, a computer science nerd, enjoys outdoor sports, a huge fan of Minecraft, blah blah blah… But in this speech, I hope to discuss not only the literal question “Who am I?” but also the philosophical question “Who am I?”

Talking about philosophy, a lot of people around me told me that I have a philosopher’s temperament. If you’ve happened to be one of my roommates, you’ll know how much I love to bother you with weird questions at night when you are just about to go to sleep. I still remember someone told me that there are 4 great philosophers in this world: Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and you guessed it, Tom. (pause). Jokes aside, I enjoy knowledge and the process of attaining knowledge. As you know that the word ‘philosophy’ means ‘loving knowledge.’ In this sense, ‘philosopher’ describes me quite accurately.

However, I brought up this topic for a more important reason. When I first came to PRISMS, I didn't realize that “loving knowledge” was part of my identity, something special about me that was different from others. In fact, if you ask the Freshman Tom, he will probably tell you that the most important thing about him is math and science — just like a stereotypical Chinese STEM student. The freshman Tom would also tell you that the only three things he cares about are grades, games, and academic competitions. Later on, He tried math competitions, which only got him completely crushed and his ego shattered into infinite pieces by the math geniuses in his school. He tried physics competitions, putting in quite a lot of effort only to realize that he didn’t have a green card, which meant he was not even qualified for the major competitions. He tried computer science competitions, which, after he put even more effort into them, made him realize that maybe he was simply not good at competitions. Yet, that kid called Tom Geng spent a significant portion of his life chasing numbers – GPAs, test scores, rankings, competition results – until he realized that these numbers wouldn’t chase him back.

Many years later, when he faced the audiences at his senior speech, Tom Geng was to remember that distant afternoon when he joined the Computer Science club as a young, ignorant kid. At that time, he met the former club leader, Steven Lu. I don’t think most people in my grade still remember Steven, but Steven did play a crucial role in Tom’s academic journey, guiding him to the “other side” of computer science. With Steven, Tom learned that computer science is more than writing C++ codes to pass testing cases on Codeforces; computers are beautiful and delicate machines. Tom began reading extracurricular computer science books and designing some small programs for fun. As he explored more and more, his road subtly began to diverge from the standard academic competitioner’s road — the road his parents expected him to go on.

The second semester of Tom’s sophomore year was when this buried family problem erupted. It was a cold day during winter break in December 2022 when he finished the USACO silver division contest. He didn’t achieve the result he wanted, but more importantly, he began to think: Is spending more time in computation olympiads what he really wants? He had several arguments with his parents regarding this issue. He had been told that he didn’t advance to the next level because he didn’t work hard enough and that he should put more effort into CS competitions. However, he gradually lost the motivation to continue in this competition. As he stared at the flashing lines of codes and head-hurting numbers, he no longer found solving problems engaging, but instead, it was becoming an insurmountable obstacle in front of him.

Being a “good student” that everyone looks up to in all his life, he had to make a tough decision now: to continue on the road of academic competition and remain a “good student” in his parents’ minds, or screw all his parents’ expectations and continue following his passion.

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both.
No matter which track you finally took,
Never make your decision one you loathe.

We don’t want depression, but sometimes depression is inevitable in our journey of growth. During young Tom’s days of depression, the most frequent question he asked himself was this speech’s title: “Who am I?”

Who am I?

What do I really want?

[long pause]

Everyone sitting there: You either already have a well-formed answer to this question, or you are still on your journey exploring the answer to this question. Of course, answers to these questions don’t naturally come to one’s mind. That guy called Tom spent so long feeling trapped between expectations and passion, between obligation and curiosity. Then, one day, something happened that shifted his perspective.

It was a normal day in Tom’s junior year. School was over, and a few people still stayed in the main building. Tom sat in room 306, staring at his computer screen, pretending to be studying. Suddenly, he saw a glimpse of sunlight coming through the window. He saw the clouds illuminating a red-orange-ish hue as if burning in the sky. At that moment, he suddenly had a strong urge to go out and capture this sunset. “This will be the most beautiful sunset I’ll ever remember.” He thought.

He ran out of the building, trying to find an angle to capture the sun. He ran to the dorm, past the soccer field, and onto Provinceline Road. He kept running and running while seeing the sunlight gradually fade away in front of him. “I won’t let it go,” he told himself.

It might be 5 minutes or 50 minutes later, he stopped at an open field, not even knowing where he was (which he later learned is called the ETS Drive). He looked up, breathing heavily. Streetlights were just turned on the moment he stopped there. The sun had already fallen down the horizon, while a small cluster of clouds still hung above his sight, reflecting the 600 to 700-nanometer electromagnetic wave that traveled 8 minutes through the empty universe between the Sun and him. Soon after, the last bit of light was gone, and everything around him fell into the endless darkness.

It was not the most beautiful sunset I had seen. Not even close. However, that glimpse of light, that relentless chasing afterward, and the joyful moment of arriving at my destination… all of those remain in my memory. When everything finally settled into the dark, I felt true peace in my mind.

I no longer blame myself endlessly for not achieving what others expect from me. Instead, I find fulfillment in the clubs I’m leading, the house events, the FTC team, the daily interaction with my friends, the small programming projects I completed in my free time, and all the actions that made me and the people around me better. Like my parents always complain, I used my 4 years of high school to try so many things without concentrating on any of them. Maybe they are right. Maybe I will do better if I can put my effort into a single activity. But do I regret my decisions? No. What I’ve chosen to do has shaped a unique ‘me’ in my own way.

Life is like a pointless chase of a glimpse of light. No matter if you are pursuing a score, an award, a college acceptance letter, or a specific person in your mind. In essence, we are all motivated by the light in our hearts that may as well fade away one day. You might not be able to capture the transient light, or you might find yourself disappointed by the reality that after all your hard work to reach the light, it’s not as amazing as you fantasized. No matter what, you’ve enjoyed the journey you’ve decided to set on. It’s all the experiences, all the adventures you’ve been through that shape who you are.

Back to my topic: who am I? I’ve kept rewriting the answer to this question again and again, but I never settled on a definite answer. Maybe, at the end of the day, the question is not “who I am,” but “what I have done” and “what I will do.” And the only way to figure out the answer is to discover that tiny bit of light in one’s heart that made one want to chase after it. Then, just keep chasing it, don’t stop, because that’s what makes us who we are after all.
